# JefBot
The bot for twitch.tv/jefmajor

Shit to do during the weekend:

Make the bot keep an updated quote database, it can fetch from the website every hour or so.

Abstact away some of the twitch lib.

Make all commands Modular, should load from it's own folder, from pure .cs files, compile, then load them inn like scripts, plug 'n play
Use a interface setup for this.

Format /Plugins/PluginName/main.cs
Format /Plugins/PluginName/Settings.txt //it's simple to keep presistant settings this way, and can be changed from chat/chats by admin/mods.
